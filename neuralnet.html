  <h1>Building Trust Profiles for AI in Healthcare</h1>
  <p><strong>Author:</strong> Lucas Benjamin</p>

  <p>
    In this project, we explore how individuals perceive AI's role in healthcare.
    By analyzing survey data on attitudes, knowledge, and demographics, we aim to construct “trust profiles” 
    — clusters of respondents with similar patterns of comfort, concern, and optimism about AI in medical contexts.
  </p>

  <h2>Data Overview</h2>
  <p>
    The data, sourced from a Pew Research Center survey, includes self-reported comfort with AI in healthcare,
    perceived risks (e.g., bias, data security), and demographic information like education, race, and ideology.
  </p>

  <h2>Dimensionality Reduction via Factor Analysis</h2>
  <p>
    To reduce noise and uncover latent themes in the data, we applied <strong>Factor Analysis</strong>. 
    This yielded two primary components:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>F1: Positive Expectancy</strong> — trust in AI’s benefits, including quality improvements and error reduction.</li>
    <li><strong>F2: Relational Impact</strong> — concern over AI depersonalizing care or harming doctor-patient relationships.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>We retained components with eigenvalues greater than 1, as shown below in the scree plot:</p>

  <h2>Clustering Trust Profiles</h2>
  <p>
    We performed KMeans clustering using the extracted factor scores. 
    The resulting clusters reflect distinct trust profiles:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Optimists</strong> — High on Positive Expectancy, low concern about relational impact.</li>
    <li><strong>Skeptics</strong> — Low expectancy, high relational concern.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Simulated Distributions</h2>
  <p>
    To validate some assumptions and visualize factor dimensions, we also generated simulated data distributions:
  </p>

  <h3>Histogram: Comfort with AI</h3>

  <h3>Histogram: Concern About Bias</h3>

  <h3>Histogram: Impact on Doctor-Patient Relationship</h3>
  <img src="images/hist_relationship.png" alt="Histogram of Doctor-Patient Relationship Impact">

  <h2>Interpretation</h2>
  <p>
    These factors may map onto real-world personas. For instance:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>The Tech-Savvy Patient:</strong> High AI knowledge, high comfort, minimal concern.</li>
    <li><strong>The Cautious Realist:</strong> Balanced expectations, but high privacy concerns.</li>
    <li><strong>The Humanist Skeptic:</strong> Low expectancy, high concern over depersonalization.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Next Steps</h2>
  <p>
    These trust profiles will serve as the foundation for predictive models that can anticipate future attitudes 
    or behaviors based on demographic and psychographic inputs.
  </p>

  <p><em>Stay tuned as we build a machine learning model to classify new respondents using these factor-derived profiles.</em></p>
